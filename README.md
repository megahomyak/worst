# worst

Worst is probably the worst Python REPL out there. I used it to get interactivity in a place where `breakpoint()` was throwing a segmentation fault for some reason

## Installation

`pip install worst`

## Usage

* Ctrl+C to exit the REPL and go back to normal code execution
* Add `\` to the end of the current line to enter a new line

Refer to [example.py](example.py) for an example
